                The outcomes of this study are expected to have significant clinical implications, offering a potential therapeutic avenue for addressing TP53 mutant clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and mitigating the risk of hematological malignancies. The CD47 antibody emerges as a promising candidate for further development as a targeted therapy, especially for CH patients with TP53 mutations.

              </li>
              <li>
                The project involves the utilization of human hematopoietic stem cells sourced from umbilical cord blood and mobilized adult peripheral blood. Employed CRISPR gene editing techniques established in the Majeti lab to selectively knock out TP53 in human CD34+ cells.   
              </li>
              <li>
                Performed in-depth in vitro and in vivo experiments to analyze the influence of CD47 blockade on various cellular processes, including phagocytosis, survival, and proliferation.
